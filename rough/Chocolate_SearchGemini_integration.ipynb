Scientists at Harvard Medical School have suggested that drinking two cups of hot chocolate a day could help keep the brain healthy and reduce memory decline in older people. Migraine risk: Some people may experience an increase in migraines when eating chocolate regularly due to cocoa’s tyramine, histamine, and phenylalanine content.\n",
        "Negative:\tAn April 2017 paper in the Journal of Food Protection showed that many chocolate bars contain undeclared allergens like milk and nuts. Unfortunately, children around the world may get unacceptable exposure to heavy metals from eating chocolate. Correlations indicated that greater chocolate intake made it more likely a participant had cancer.\n",
        "Negative:\tBozbulut R, Sanlier N, Döger E, Bideci A, Çamurdan O, Cinaz P. The effect of beta-glucan supplementation on glycemic control and variability in adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Decroix L, De Pauw K, Van Cutsem J, Pattyn N, Heyman E, Meeusen R. Acute cocoa flavanols intake improves cerebral hemodynamics while maintaining brain activity and cognitive performance in moderate hypoxia. Jenkins J, Williams D, Deng Y, et al. Eltrombopag, an oral thrombopoietin receptor agonist, has no impact on the pharmacokinetic profile of probe drugs for cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 in healthy men: a cocktail analysis.\n",
        "Positive:\tResearch shows that, unlike men, many women have feelings of guilt when eating this potentially “forbidden” food, or they fight the urge to eat it at all. This may be related to dark chocolate’s effects on heart health, since stress is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Researchers have not come up with a hard and fast recommendation of how much dark chocolate should be consumed to achieve these health benefits.\n",
        "Positive:\tThe researchers set out to investigate whether chocolate bars containing plant sterols (PS) and cocoa flavanols (CF) have any effect on cholesterol levels. Scientists at Harvard Medical School have suggested that drinking two cups of hot chocolate a day could help keep the brain healthy and reduce memory decline in older people. Migraine risk: Some people may experience an increase in migraines when eating chocolate regularly due to cocoa’s tyramine, histamine, and phenylalanine content.\n",
        "Positive:\tAccording to research, the polyphenols in dark chocolate may help lower some forms of LDL (“bad”) cholesterol when combined with other foods like almonds and cocoa ( 3). It’s possible that people who are already receiving treatment for high blood pressure may not get any additional benefit from adding cocoa flavanols to their diet. Additionally, cocoa contains stimulant substances like caffeine and theobromine, which may be a key reason why it can improve brain function in the short term ( 19).\"\"\""
